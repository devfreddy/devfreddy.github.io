# Construction Banner Feature

## Overview
A persistent footer banner that indicates the site is under active development with Claude Code.

## What Problem Does This Solve?
- Sets visitor expectations about site status
- Provides branding opportunity ("Built with Claude Code")
- Non-intrusive footer placement (doesn't obstruct content)
- Always visible without needing user interaction

## User Interaction (Updated 2025-10-12)
- Banner appears at bottom of page (footer position)
- Always visible across all pages
- No dismiss functionality (permanent display)
- Does not affect other component spacing

## Previous Behavior (Deprecated 2025-10-12)
~~Banner appeared at top of page on first visit~~
~~Click "hide" to dismiss banner~~
~~Dismissal persisted across page reloads and tabs~~
~~Navbar and hero section adjusted spacing dynamically~~

## Technical Highlights
- **Fixed positioning**: Always visible at bottom of viewport
- **Gradient styling**: Colorful background with tech icons
- **Zero state management**: Simplified from localStorage-based approach
- **No layout impact**: Other components maintain consistent spacing
