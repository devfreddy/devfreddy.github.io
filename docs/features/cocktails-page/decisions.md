# Cocktails Page - Design Decisions

## Why This Approach vs Alternatives?

### Static JSON vs API/Database
**Decision: Use static JSON file**

**Rationale:**
- No backend infrastructure needed
- Fast load times (bundled with app)
- Easy to version control recipe changes
- Sufficient for portfolio demonstration
- Can easily migrate to API later if needed

**Alternatives Considered:**
- External API: Adds complexity, potential failures
- Database: Overkill for static content
- CMS: Too heavy for simple recipe list

### useMemo vs No Optimization
**Decision: Use useMemo for filtering**

**Rationale:**
- Prevents unnecessary recalculation of filtered results
- Improves performance on re-renders
- Best practice for derived data
- Minimal code overhead

### Custom CSS vs Chakra UI
**Decision: Use custom CSS for cocktails page**

**Rationale:**
- More design control for card layouts
- Lighter bundle (no extra Chakra components)
- Custom grid styling easier with CSS
- Consistent with rest of cocktail page design

## Trade-offs Made

### Search Performance vs UX
- No debouncing: Instant feedback but more re-renders
- Acceptable trade-off for current dataset size

### Features vs Simplicity
- No sorting, pagination, or favorites
- Keeps implementation clean and focused
- Can add features incrementally

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add debounced search for better performance
- [ ] Implement sorting (alphabetical, by category)
- [ ] Add favorites/saved recipes (localStorage)
- [ ] Include cocktail images
- [ ] Add difficulty ratings
- [ ] Export/share recipe functionality

## Lessons Learned

- useMemo significantly helps with filter performance
- Simple filter logic is easier to maintain than complex state machines
- Real-time filtering feels more responsive than "submit" button
- Category filter complements search nicely

## Related Features

- **Navigation System**: Provides route access
- **Dark Mode**: Cocktail page should support dark theme (future)
- **Client-Side Routing**: Ensures direct URL access works
