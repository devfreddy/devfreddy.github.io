# Session Wrap-Up: 2025-10-13

## Summary

Comprehensive content refresh focused on authenticity and pre-sales positioning. Rewrote Hero, About, and Experience sections to reflect current role (Staff Solutions Architect), emphasize observability expertise, and incorporate elevator pitch themes (detective/teacher approach, situational intelligence, enabling teams). Fixed spacing issues throughout About and Experience sections for better visual hierarchy.

## What Was Accomplished

### Content Improvements - Hero Section
- ✅ Changed heading from generic "Welcome" to "Michael Frederick"
- ✅ Updated subheading to pre-sales focused: "I Help Customers Navigate Complex Technical Decisions"
- ✅ Rewrote description to emphasize Staff Solutions Architect role
- ✅ Highlighted GraphQL, observability, and distributed systems expertise
- ✅ Aligned messaging with customer-focused pre-sales positioning

### Content Improvements - About Section
- ✅ Completely rewrote opening paragraph combining detective/teacher approach with 15+ years experience narrative
- ✅ Replaced generic "My Story" with authentic tech support origin story
- ✅ Emphasized progression from tech support → database admin → engineering → solutions architecture
- ✅ Connected hobbies to problem-solving philosophy ("stepping away and thinking differently")
- ✅ Added 7th item to "What I Do": Root cause analysis & problem diagnosis

### Content Improvements - Experience Section
- ✅ Updated Apollo title from "Senior Professional Services Engineer" to "Staff Solutions Architect"
- ✅ Added Observability SME achievements and OpenTelemetry expertise to Apollo role
- ✅ Emphasized "what to measure" guidance and dashboard building
- ✅ Enhanced New Relic Partner role with observability-specific terminology (APM, distributed tracing, infrastructure monitoring)
- ✅ Updated New Relic Engineering role to highlight observability agent architecture and instrumentation
- ✅ Added OpenTelemetry, Datadog, and New Relic to tech stacks across roles

### Spacing and Layout Fixes
- ✅ Reduced top padding in About section (`py={20}` → `pt={0} pb={12}`)
- ✅ Reduced top padding in Experience section (`py={20}` → `pt={0} pb={12}`)
- ✅ Adjusted VStack spacing in Experience section (12 → 8)
- ✅ Added margin to section headers for better hierarchy
- ✅ Added horizontal padding between "My Story" and "What I Do" columns (`pr/pl={4}`)
- ✅ Increased bottom margin on subsection headers (`mb={4}` → `mb={6}`)

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Pre-Sales Positioning**: Chose customer-focused language over team/internal language to align with pre-sales role applications
2. **Observability Emphasis**: Positioned observability expertise prominently (second after GraphQL) across all relevant roles to target O11y companies
3. **Authentic Storytelling**: Used real tech support origin story instead of generic "passionate developer" narrative
4. **Elevator Pitch Integration**: Wove detective/teacher themes and situational intelligence throughout content
5. **Spacing Philosophy**: Removed top padding, kept bottom padding for consistent section flow

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Review Content Live**: View the changes on the deployed site after pushing
2. **Consider Mobile View**: Test responsive behavior on mobile devices
3. **Iterate on "My Story"**: User noted they may want to refine this section further
4. **Projects Section**: Next priority from docs/README.md (#2 on "This Week" list)

### Short Term
1. **Contact Form/Section**: Add contact section or form (Priority #3)
2. **Accessibility Improvements**: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation (Priority #4)
3. **Dark Mode Testing**: Verify all new content looks good in dark mode
4. **Content Proofreading**: Have someone else review the new content for clarity and tone

### Long Term
1. **A/B Testing Messages**: Consider testing different value propositions for different audiences (pre-sales vs. IC roles)
2. **Case Studies**: Add specific customer success stories or project highlights
3. **Testimonials**: Include quotes from colleagues or customers
4. **Blog Content**: Write articles about observability, GraphQL, or situational leadership
