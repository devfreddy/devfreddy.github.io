- Floating Tech Icons
- Dark Mode
- Client-Side Routing

### 2. Accessibility Improvements (Priority: High)
- Add prefers-reduced-motion support
- Implement ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout
- Test with screen readers

### 3. Add Projects Section (Priority: Medium)
- Un-comment ProjectsSection component
- Create project data structure
- Implement filtering and sorting
- Add project detail views

### 4. Performance Optimization (Priority: Medium)
- Analyze bundle size
- Optimize particle count for mobile
- Implement lazy loading
- Add performance monitoring

### 5. Create Contact Section (Priority: Medium)
- Design contact form or info section
- Add social media links
- Include professional contact methods

## User Actions Required

**None** - This was a documentation-only session. All changes are ready to commit.

## Blockers

**None identified**

## Key Insights

### Project Strengths
- Clean, well-organized codebase
- Modern tech stack (React 19, Vite 7, Chakra UI 3)
- Strategic use of performance optimizations (useMemo)
- Good separation of concerns (custom hooks, component isolation)

### Opportunities
- 7 features still need detailed documentation
- Accessibility could be significantly improved
- Projects section is ready to implement (currently commented out)
- Performance optimizations available (mobile particle count, lazy loading)

### Process Value
- Feature-driven documentation makes codebase highly navigable
- Session tracking creates valuable historical context
- Clear TODO list provides development roadmap
- Master project framework scales well to existing projects
