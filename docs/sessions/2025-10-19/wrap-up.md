# Session Wrap-Up - 2025-10-19

## Summary

Created a new musing post discussing Z.AI's GLM-4.6 with Roo as an alternative to Claude Code. The post explores the trade-offs between cost savings and capability, and includes a note about issues encountered with Cline's tool use functionality.

## What Was Accomplished

- **Created new musing**: [exploring-glm-4-6-roo-alternative.md](frontend-project/src/musings/exploring-glm-4-6-roo-alternative.md)
  - Discusses Z.AI's GLM-4.6 paired with Roo in VS Code
  - Compares cost, capability, and reliability against Claude Code
  - Documents the dealbreaker bug found with Cline (tool use stuck in pending state)
  - Concise, well-structured post emphasizing practical trade-offs

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- Nothing blockingâ€”post is ready and live on the site

### Short Term
- Continue testing GLM-4.6/Roo setup and document any additional findings
- Monitor if Cline releases a fix for the tool-use pending state issue

### Long Term
- Evaluate other AI coding assistant alternatives as they emerge
- Consider periodic comparison posts as the landscape evolves

## Notes

- The musing was tightened up to remove redundancy while maintaining clarity
- Post emphasizes pragmatism: choosing tools based on project trade-offs rather than defaults
- All content is in place and automatically discoverable on the site
