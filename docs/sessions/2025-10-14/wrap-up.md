# Session Wrap-Up: 2025-10-14

## Summary

Brief session focused on organizing brand assets and updating site favicon. Renamed icon files from generic directional names to standardized logo naming convention and implemented proper favicon configuration with multiple formats for browser compatibility.

## What Was Accomplished

### Asset Organization
- Renamed 10 icon files from `top_left_*` and `bottom_right_*` to `logo-one_*` and `logo-two_*`
- Established consistent naming convention for brand assets:
  - `logo-one.*` (formerly top_left)
  - `logo-two.*` (formerly bottom_right)
- All formats preserved: .ico, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 180x180

### Favicon Implementation
- Updated [frontend-project/index.html](../../frontend-project/index.html) to use logo-one as site favicon
- Replaced generic vite.svg favicon with custom brand icon
- Implemented multi-format favicon for better browser compatibility:
  - Standard .ico file for legacy browsers
  - PNG versions in multiple sizes (16x16, 32x32)
  - Apple touch icon (180x180) for iOS devices

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
- Test favicon display across different browsers
- Consider if logo-two should be used for any specific purpose (dark mode variant?)
- Clean up old vite.svg if no longer needed

### Short Term
- Document brand asset usage guidelines if multiple logos serve different purposes
- Consider adding favicon to 404.html page as well

### Long Term
- Establish comprehensive brand asset management strategy
- Consider adding manifest.json for PWA support with icon references

## Technical Notes

- Icons are located in `frontend-project/src/assets/`
- Both logo sets include identical size variations
- Favicon paths in HTML use `/src/assets/` convention for Vite
