# Session Wrap-Up - 2025-10-15

## Summary

Implemented a new "Musings" blog section with markdown rendering capabilities and created a custom slash command for easily writing new posts. Also hidden the cocktails page from public navigation while keeping it accessible via direct URL.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Hidden Cocktails Page from Public
- Removed "Cocktails" navigation link from [Navbar.jsx](../../frontend-project/src/components/Navbar.jsx)
- Route remains active at `/cocktails` for direct URL access
- Page is now "security through obscurity" - accessible to you but not discoverable by visitors

### 2. Created Musings Blog Section
- **Installed dependencies**:
  - `react-markdown` - Markdown rendering
  - `gray-matter` - Frontmatter parsing (title, date, tags, etc.)
  - `remark-gfm` - GitHub-flavored markdown support (tables, task lists)

- **Created [MusingsPage.jsx](../../frontend-project/src/components/MusingsPage.jsx)**:
  - List view showing all posts with title, date, excerpt, and tags
  - Detail view for individual posts with full markdown rendering
  - Automatic post discovery from `src/musings/*.md` files
  - Click-through navigation from list to post
  - Back button to return to list
  - Posts sorted by date (newest first)
  - Styled markdown with proper heading hierarchy, code blocks, blockquotes, lists, and links
  - Dark mode support throughout

- **Created blog post structure**:
  - Directory: `frontend-project/src/musings/`
  - Sample post: [welcome.md](../../frontend-project/src/musings/welcome.md)
  - Frontmatter format:
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: Post Title
    date: YYYY-MM-DD
    excerpt: Brief description
    tags: [tag1, tag2]
    ---
    ```

- **Updated navigation**:
  - Added "Musings" link to [Navbar.jsx](../../frontend-project/src/components/Navbar.jsx)
  - Shows on both home page and other pages
  - Highlights when active (blue color)
  - Added route `/musings/*` in [App.jsx](../../frontend-project/src/App.jsx)

### 3. Created Custom Slash Command
- Created [/new-musing](../../.claude/commands/new-musing.md) command
- Prompts for:
  - Title
  - Slug (URL-friendly name)
  - Excerpt
  - Tags
  - Initial content (optional)
- Creates markdown file with proper frontmatter structure
- Provides structured template with sections for organization
- Includes usage guidelines and examples

## Key Decisions

### Architecture
- **Vite's `import.meta.glob`**: Used for automatic markdown file discovery instead of manual imports
- **Client-side markdown parsing**: Using `gray-matter` to parse frontmatter on the client
- **Nested routes**: `/musings/*` with subroutes for individual posts
- **URL structure**: Clean `/musings/{slug}` URLs

### Content Structure
- Posts live in `src/musings/` (alongside source code)
- Each post is a standalone markdown file
- Frontmatter provides metadata without requiring a separate index
- Simple filename = slug convention

### Styling
- Inline style object for markdown content (easier to maintain than separate CSS)
- Responsive Chakra UI tokens for consistent theming
- Proper typography hierarchy for readability
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting support

## Technical Details

### How Markdown Loading Works
```javascript
// Import all markdown files as raw strings
const posts = import.meta.glob('../musings/*.md', { query: '?raw', import: 'default' })

// Load and parse on mount
for (const path in posts) {
  const content = await posts[path]()
  const { data, content: markdown } = matter(content)
  // data = frontmatter, markdown = content
}
```

### Routing Structure
```
/musings          → List of all posts
/musings/welcome  → Individual post view
/musings/{slug}   → Dynamic post view
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Created
- `frontend-project/src/components/MusingsPage.jsx` - Blog component
- `frontend-project/src/musings/welcome.md` - Sample post
- `.claude/commands/new-musing.md` - Slash command

### Modified
- `frontend-project/src/App.jsx` - Added musings route
- `frontend-project/src/components/Navbar.jsx` - Added musings link, removed cocktails link
- `frontend-project/package.json` - Added markdown dependencies
- `frontend-project/package-lock.json` - Dependency lockfile

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Write first real musing** - Test the `/new-musing` command with actual content
2. **Test the musings page** - Run dev server and verify everything works
3. **Verify deployment** - Ensure markdown files are included in build

### Short Term
1. **Add RSS feed** - For blog subscribers
2. **SEO metadata** - Add meta tags for social sharing
3. **Reading time estimate** - Calculate and display reading time
4. **Table of contents** - Auto-generate TOC from headings

### Long Term
1. **Search functionality** - Search posts by title/content/tags
2. **Tag filtering** - Filter posts by tag
3. **Related posts** - Show related posts based on tags
4. **Comments** - Consider integration (Giscus, Utterances)
5. **Analytics** - Track popular posts

## Prerequisites for Next Session

None - ready to start writing!

## Notes

- The musings section is now publicly visible and ready for content
- The cocktails page is now hidden but still accessible at `/cocktails`
- The `/new-musing` command makes it easy to create new posts
- All markdown features are supported (code blocks, tables, lists, quotes, etc.)
- Posts automatically appear in the list when added to `src/musings/`
- Dark mode works throughout the blog section
- Mobile responsive design included

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run dev server and verify musings list shows welcome post
- [ ] Click into welcome post and verify markdown renders correctly
- [ ] Test back button navigation
- [ ] Verify dark mode works on both list and detail views
- [ ] Test `/new-musing` slash command
- [ ] Verify cocktails link is gone from navbar
- [ ] Verify `/cocktails` still works via direct URL
- [ ] Check mobile responsive design
- [ ] Test with multiple posts (create 2-3 more)
- [ ] Verify posts sort by date correctly
