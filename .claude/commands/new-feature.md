# New Feature Documentation

Add documentation for a new feature to the consolidated FEATURES.md file.

## Instructions

Ask the user for the feature name and details if not already provided, then:

## 1. Read Current Features

Read `docs/FEATURES.md` to understand the current structure and avoid duplicates.

## 2. Add Feature to Catalog Table

Add a new row to the Feature Catalog table at the top of `docs/FEATURES.md`:

```markdown
| [Feature Name](#feature-name-anchor) | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | `src/path/to/file.jsx` | Dependencies |
```

Status options:
- ðŸŸ¢ Complete
- ðŸŸ¡ In Progress
- ðŸ”´ Planned
- âšª Not Started

## 3. Add Feature Section

Add a new section to `docs/FEATURES.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
## Feature Name

### Overview
[Brief description of what this feature does]

### What It Does
- Key capability 1
- Key capability 2
- Key capability 3
- User interaction details

### Key Props (if applicable)
\`\`\`jsx
<ComponentName
  prop1={type}  // Description
  prop2={type}  // Description
/>
\`\`\`

### Technical Details
- **File**: `src/path/to/file.jsx`
- **Dependencies**: List of dependencies
- **State Management**: How state is handled
- **Performance**: Key performance considerations

### Implementation Notes
- Important implementation details
- Known limitations
- Edge cases

### Future Enhancements (if applicable)
- Planned improvement 1
- Planned improvement 2

---
```

## 4. Update Feature Dependencies Graph (if needed)

If the new feature has dependencies on other features, update the dependencies graph section.

## 5. Update docs/README.md

Add the feature to the appropriate status section in `docs/README.md`:

- **Completed Features âœ…** - If status is ðŸŸ¢
- **In Progress ðŸš§** - If status is ðŸŸ¡
- **Planned ðŸ“‹** - If status is ðŸ”´ or âšª

## 6. Inform User

Tell the user:

```markdown
âœ… Added feature documentation for: [Feature Name]

**Updated files:**
- [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md) - Added feature section
- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) - Updated feature status

**Next steps:**
1. Implement the feature
2. Update documentation as you build
3. Mark as complete when done

The feature is currently marked as [status]. Update the status in both files as you make progress.

Would you like me to help you start implementing this feature?
```

## Notes

- Use Title Case for feature names in headings
- Use kebab-case for anchor links
- Keep descriptions concise and actionable
- Include code examples where helpful
- Link to actual file paths in the codebase
- Update the feature status as work progresses
- If the feature is complex, you can expand the documentation, but try to keep it in a single section

## Example Feature Entry

```markdown
## Contact Form

### Overview
User-facing contact form with validation and email integration.

### What It Does
- Collects user inquiries (name, email, message)
- Client-side validation for all fields

/>
\`\`\`

### Technical Details
- **File**: `src/components/ContactForm.jsx`
- **Dependencies**: Chakra UI, React Hook Form, reCAPTCHA
