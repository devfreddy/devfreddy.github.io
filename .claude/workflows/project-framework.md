# Project Framework Workflow

## Overview
This workflow defines the documentation and development practices for this portfolio project, based on a master project framework that emphasizes feature-driven development, comprehensive documentation, and session tracking.

## Working Style

### Autonomy Level
- Be persistent and autonomous - keep going until the task is completely resolved
- Only stop when you're certain the problem is solved or need critical input
- Don't ask for confirmation on reasonable assumptions - document them and proceed
- Research uncertainties rather than stopping - deduce the most reasonable approach

### Communication Style
- Begin each major task by rephrasing my goal clearly and concisely
- Outline your approach with a structured plan before diving in
- Provide progress updates as you work through complex tasks
- Summarize completed work at natural breakpoints
- Use markdown formatting with clear headers and bullet points

### Verbosity Preferences
- Status updates: Brief and focused
- Code/technical work: Detailed with clear comments
- Documentation: Comprehensive but scannable
- Explanations: Step-by-step reasoning for complex decisions

## Documentation Structure

This project follows a feature-driven documentation pattern:

```
project-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 # Project overview, setup, key features
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/            # Feature-by-feature documentation
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.md         # Feature catalog with status
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [feature-name]/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ README.md    # Feature overview and usage
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ implementation.md  # Technical details
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ testing.md   # Test cases and validation
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ decisions.md # Design decisions and trade-offs
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sessions/            # Session-by-session progress tracking
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ YYYY-MM-DD/
â”‚   â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ notes.md     # What was accomplished, findings, blockers
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ wrap-up.md   # Summary and next steps
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ COMMANDS.md          # Useful commands and patterns discovered
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SETUP_LOG.md         # Installation and configuration history
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ TODO.md              # Task tracking with phases/milestones
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                 # Any automation or helper scripts
â””â”€â”€ .claude/                 # Claude-specific workflows and config
```

## Feature Documentation Pattern

For each discrete feature or component:

**Create/Update `docs/features/[feature-name]/` with:**

1. **README.md** - Feature overview
   - What problem does this solve?
   - How does a user interact with it?
   - Quick start examples
   - Configuration options
   - Common use cases

2. **implementation.md** - Technical details
   - Architecture and design patterns
   - Key files and functions
   - Data flow and state management
   - Dependencies and integrations
   - Performance considerations

3. **testing.md** - Validation approach
   - Test cases and coverage
   - Manual testing procedures
   - Edge cases and error handling
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Known limitations

4. **decisions.md** - Design rationale
   - Why this approach vs alternatives?
   - Trade-offs made
   - Future improvements considered
   - Lessons learned
   - Related features or impacts

**Update `docs/features/index.md`** with:
- Feature name and one-line description
- Status: ðŸŸ¢ Complete | ðŸŸ¡ In Progress | ðŸ”´ Planned | âšª Deprecated
- Links to feature folder
- Dependencies on other features
- Session dates when worked on

## Session Documentation Pattern

For each work session, track in `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/notes.md`:
- **Accomplishments:** What was completed with âœ… markers
- **Key Findings:** Important discoveries or insights
- **Configuration Changes:** Any setup or settings modified
- **Known Issues:** Problems discovered but not yet resolved
- **Next Steps:** Specific, actionable items for continuation
- **Files Modified:** List of what changed and why
- **Features Touched:** Link to relevant feature documentation

## Working Principles

### Planning & Execution
1. **Decompose First:** Break complex tasks into explicit requirements, unclear areas, and hidden assumptions
2. **Map the Scope:** Identify all relevant files, functions, and dependencies before starting
3. **Research Thoroughly:** Use tools to understand the codebase/content - don't guess
4. **Define Success:** Specify exact deliverables and success criteria upfront
5. **Verify Continuously:** Test and validate work as you progress
6. **Document Features:** Each significant capability gets its own feature documentation

### Feature-Driven Development
When building or modifying functionality:
1. **Check feature index** first - does this feature already exist?
2. **Create feature folder** if new, with all four documentation files
3. **Document while building** - not after
4. **Link features** that depend on or relate to each other
5. **Track feature status** accurately (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´âšª)

### Code/Content Creation Guidelines
- **Quality over Speed:** Fix root causes, not symptoms
- **Consistency:** Match existing style and patterns in the project
- **Minimal Changes:** Make focused updates that solve the specific problem
- **Documentation:** Update relevant docs as you modify functionality
- **Clean Up:** Remove debug code, temp files, and unnecessary comments before finishing
- **Feature Isolation:** Keep feature changes discrete and well-bounded

### Tool Usage Patterns
- **Search/Research:** Gather context broadly first, then narrow focus
- **File Operations:** Use batch operations where possible for efficiency
- **Version Control:** Create descriptive commits that explain what and why
- **Testing:** Verify changes work before declaring completion

## Session Wrap-Up Protocol

When I say "wrap this session up", follow this workflow:

1. **Review Accomplishments**
   - List what was completed (with âœ… markers)
   - Note incomplete work and blockers
   - Identify key learnings or insights
   - List which features were worked on

2. **Update Feature Documentation**
   - For each feature touched this session:
     - Create new feature folder if needed
     - Update implementation.md with changes made
     - Add test cases to testing.md
     - Document design decisions in decisions.md
     - Update feature README.md with new capabilities
   - Update `docs/features/index.md` catalog

3. **Update Session Documentation**
   - Create session notes in `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/notes.md`
   - Link to relevant feature documentation
   - Update TODO.md with completed/new items
   - Add useful commands to COMMANDS.md
   - Update main README.md if project capabilities changed

4. **Create Next Steps**
   - Specific, actionable items for next session
   - Which features need more work
   - Prerequisites or preparations needed
   - Order of tasks to tackle
   - Any blockers or dependencies

5. **Commit Changes**
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Session YYYY-MM-DD: [Brief summary]

   Features:
   - [Feature 1]: [What changed]
   - [Feature 2]: [What changed]

   Documentation:
   - Updated feature docs for [features touched]
   - Session notes added

   Next: [Primary next step]

   Created with Claude Code"
   ```

6. **Provide Summary**
   - Features worked on (with links to docs)
   - What was accomplished (high-level bullets)
   - Documentation updates made
   - Next session starting points
   - Any user actions required

## Using This Workflow

To activate this workflow in a session, simply reference it:
- "Follow the project framework workflow"
- "Use the session wrap-up protocol"
- "Document this feature following our framework"

### Session Wrap-Up Triggers

**IMPORTANT:** When you hear ANY of these phrases, IMMEDIATELY activate the Session Wrap-Up Protocol (see section above):
- "wrap this session up"
- "let's wrap up"
- "wrap up this session"
- "let's wrap this up"
- "wrap it up"
- "use the wrap-up protocol"
- "finish this session"

The protocol is a 6-step process that MUST be completed in order:
1. âœ… Review Accomplishments
2. âœ… Update Feature Documentation
3. âœ… Update Session Documentation
4. âœ… Create Next Steps
5. âœ… Commit Changes (with proper format)
6. âœ… Provide Summary

Do NOT skip steps or provide a casual summary - follow the complete protocol.

The workflow will guide documentation practices, session management, and commit conventions throughout development.
