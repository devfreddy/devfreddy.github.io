# Initialize SDLC Workflow for This Project

I want to implement the SDLC workflow framework that's now in `.claude/sdlc-workflow.md`. Please complete the following setup steps:

## 1. Create Project Structure

Create all the necessary directories and files for the SDLC workflow:
- Create the full directory structure as defined in the workflow document
- Set up the `.claude/` directory with configuration files
- Create the `docs/` subdirectories (features, sessions, architecture)
- Set up the `scripts/` directory

## 2. Create Automation Scripts

Create the three main automation scripts in `scripts/`:
- `startup.sh` - The session initialization script from the workflow
- `wrap-up.sh` - The session wrap-up automation script  
- `new-feature.sh` - The feature scaffolding script
- Make all scripts executable with proper shebang lines

## 3. Generate Project Configuration

Create `.claude/project-config.yaml` based on this project's specifics:
- Analyze the existing code to determine project type, tech stack, and conventions
- Set appropriate preferences for working style and development approach
- Configure feature flags based on the project needs
- Add any project-specific conventions you observe

## 4. Initialize Documentation

- Create `docs/features/index.md` with a catalog structure for tracking features
- Create `docs/ROADMAP.md` with sections for current sprint, backlog, and future vision
- Create `docs/COMMANDS.md` with any useful commands found in the existing project
- Create `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` template for tracking issues and solutions
- Create `docs/architecture/overview.md` with a high-level description of the current project architecture

## 5. Document Existing Features

If there are already clear features/components in this project:
- Identify the main features/components currently in the codebase
- Create feature documentation folders for the most important 2-3 features
- Fill in basic README.md for each identified feature
- Mark their status appropriately in the feature index

## 6. Create First Session

- Create today's session directory: `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- Create `notes.md` documenting that we initialized the SDLC workflow
- Note any existing TODOs or issues you observe in the project
- Identify logical next steps for future sessions

## 7. Test the Workflow

- Run the `startup.sh` script to verify it works correctly
- Confirm it generates the context file at `.claude/startup-context.md`
- Make any necessary adjustments to paths or scripts based on this project's structure

## 8. Create Implementation Summary

After completing all steps, provide me with:
- A summary of what was created
- Any project-specific customizations made
- Current project state based on your analysis
- Suggested first feature to work on using this workflow
- Any issues encountered or adjustments needed

## Instructions

Please proceed with implementing this workflow, creating actual files (not just examples), and adapting everything to fit this specific project's needs. Let me know when you've completed the setup and we can test it with our first proper SDLC session.
