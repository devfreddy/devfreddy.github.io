# My Journey with LLMs and Claude: What 400+ Conversations Taught Me

For most of 2025, I was a skeptic. I'd tried various LLMs through web interfaces, attempted to get them to write code, and consistently found the experience frustrating and unproductive. My usage was light, sporadic, and frankly disappointing.

Then September happened.

I switched to Claude Code, and everything changed. October 2025 represents a complete inflection point in my AI usage—not just in volume, but in how I work, learn, and solve problems. The data tells a fascinating story about this transformation.

## Why Track LLM Usage?

I built a comprehensive tracking system using [ccusage](https://ccusage.com/) to understand my consumption patterns, costs, and productivity gains. This isn't just about numbers—it's about understanding how AI tools are changing my work and learning processes.

My setup tracks usage across my personal MacBook Air and work MacBook Pro, with automated daily snapshots versioned in Git. I monitor:
- Input and output tokens
- Cache creates and reads (where the real cost savings happen)
- Daily costs broken down by model
- Conversation patterns and topics

## The Numbers Tell a Story

Over a recent 7-day period (Oct 11-18, 2025), my usage showed remarkable growth:

**Volume Metrics:**
- Total conversations: **+49 items** (+13.9%)
- Total words: **+90,164 words** (+33.3%)
- Average conversation length: **900 words** (up from 770)
- Longest single conversation: **13,183 words** on developing a Claude Code workflow

This isn't just more conversations—it's *deeper* conversations. The 33% increase in word count with only 14% more conversations means I'm engaging in substantially more complex, detailed work with Claude.

## The Inflection Point: September → October

For most of 2025, my LLM usage was minimal. Trying to get AI to write code through web interfaces was clunky, context-limited, and often more frustrating than helpful. I'd open Claude.ai, paste some code, get a response, copy it back—rinse and repeat. It felt like using a chatbot, not collaborating with a tool.

**Then I discovered Claude Code in September.**

October 2025 showed explosive growth:
- **Week 40**: 59 items, 54,525 words
- **Week 41**: 44 items in just 6 days, 58,756 words

But it's not just volume—it's the *nature* of the work. I'm having fewer but richer conversations, tackling complex problems I would never have attempted through a web interface. The difference? Context, continuity, and integration into my actual development workflow.

## How I Actually Use Claude

### Topic Distribution

My conversation history reveals where I'm spending my time:

| Topic | Conversations | Avg Words | Insights |
|-------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| **General/Other** | 262 (65.3%) | - | Daily problem-solving, quick questions |
| **Data Science** | 28 (7.0%) | 1,927 | Complex technical work, up +21% in avg length |
| **Research** | 35 (8.7%) | - | Technology evaluation, learning |
| **Coding** | 27 (6.7%) | 1,600 | Substantial programming tasks, up 38% in depth |
| **Writing** | 5 (1.2%) | - | Tripled this period—creative/narrative work |

### The Long Tail: Deep Dives

My longest conversations reveal what really captures my attention:

1. **Claude Code Workflow** (13,183 words) - Meta: using Claude to optimize how I use Claude
2. **Apple Hardware for Local LLMs** (10,900 words) - Exploring alternatives and understanding the landscape
3. **Mental Health Research** (7,643 words) - Personal health research
4. **Gym Rubber Flooring** (5,419 words) - Detailed home project planning

These aren't casual chats—they're research sessions, debugging marathons, and planning exercises that would traditionally involve hours of Google searches, documentation reading, and forum browsing.

## Technologies & Learning Patterns

Technology mention growth over the period:

| Technology | Previous | Current | Growth |
|------------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Claude** | 332 | 379 | +14.2% (meta-conversations about AI) |
| **Go** | 69 | 83 | +20.3% |
| **Apollo GraphQL** | 55 | 66 | +20.0% |
| **Python** | 25 | 32 | +28.0% |

### Question Patterns: How I Engage

My interaction patterns show increasing sophistication:

| Pattern | Growth | Interpretation |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **"How to..."** questions | +36.8% | Active learning, skill-building |
| **"What is..."** questions | +41.7% | Foundation-building, new domains |
| **Creation requests** | +32.1% | More building, less asking |
| **Review requests** | +25.0% | Using Claude for code review |
| **Debugging** | +24.7% | Real-world problem-solving |

I'm not just asking Claude *about* things—I'm asking it to *create* things (+32%), *review* my work (+25%), and *debug* problems (+25%). This is active collaboration, not passive information retrieval.

## Emerging Patterns & Insights

### 1. Conversation Depth Over Breadth

I'm having **fewer, longer conversations**. This suggests:
- Better problem scoping upfront
- More complex problems being tackled
- Building context within conversations rather than starting fresh

### 2. Technical Specialization

Clear clusters emerging:
- **Apollo Router/GraphQL**: 79 conversations (dominant expertise area)
- **Claude Code workflows**: Meta-optimization of AI usage

### 3. Cross-Domain Application

From cocktail recipes to health research, from home improvement to GraphQL debugging—Claude serves as a universal thinking partner across:
- Professional technical work
- Personal projects and hobbies
- Health and wellness research
- Creative writing and documentation

### 4. The Documentation Impulse

Recent surge in **writing** topics (tripled) and creation of workflow documentation suggests I'm:
- Extracting reusable patterns from conversations
- Building personal knowledge bases
- Sharing insights and methods

## What This Means for How I Work

### Before Claude Code (Most of 2025)

**Research**: Google → Stack Overflow → Documentation → Forums → Trial & Error
**Learning**: Courses → Books → Videos → Practice → More practice
**Debugging**: Logs → Google → Stack Overflow → Colleague → More logs
**Writing**: Outline → Draft → Revise → Revise → Revise
**LLM Usage**: Occasional web interface queries, mostly disappointing

### After Claude Code (September/October 2025)

**Research**: Focused conversation → Immediate clarifications → Deep dives as needed
**Learning**: Direct Q&A → Concept building → Hands-on with expert guidance → Rapid iteration
**Debugging**: Context dump → Collaborative analysis → Solution proposals → Quick validation
**Writing**: Brainstorm → Structure → Draft with feedback → Targeted refinements
**LLM Usage**: Integrated into every aspect of my workflow

## What Surprises Me

**The Speed of Adoption**: I went from skeptical light user to having my longest conversation ever (13,183 words) in just a few weeks. The difference wasn't the AI—it was the *interface*.

**The Meta Effect**: My longest conversation is about optimizing how I use Claude. We've reached the AI optimization singularity.

**Why Web Interfaces Failed**: Looking back, it's obvious. Copy-pasting code back and forth, losing context between sessions, no integration with my actual development environment—of course it felt clunky. Claude Code solved all of that.

**Domain Flexibility**: The same tool helps me research health topics, debug GraphQL routers, plan home gym flooring, and optimize my development workflows.

**Depth Preference**: I naturally gravitate toward longer, more detailed conversations rather than quick hits—suggesting Claude excels at complex problems when given the right environment.

## What I've Learned

**Prompt Engineering in Practice**: My increasing conversation depth (770 → 900 avg words) reflects better prompting—I provide more context upfront, leading to more useful responses.

**Cache-Aware Workflows**: Understanding caching changes how I structure work—keeping conversations going rather than starting fresh saves money and maintains context.

**Multi-Device Reality**: Tracking across work/personal devices reveals different usage patterns—work is more focused on specific technologies, personal is more exploratory.

**AI as Thought Partner**: The best conversations aren't where Claude gives answers, but where it helps me think through problems systematically.

## The Learning Flywheel

1. Use Claude for technical work
2. Learn better ways to use Claude
3. Document those workflows
4. Use Claude more effectively
5. Take on more complex problems
6. (Repeat)

## Conclusion

The data tells a clear story: I went from LLM skeptic to power user in two months.

The key wasn't better AI models—it was **better integration**. Web interfaces kept AI at arm's length, a tool I'd occasionally consult but never truly collaborate with. Claude Code brought the AI into my development environment, maintaining context, accessing my codebase, and actually understanding what I'm working on.

The 33% increase in conversation depth, the emergence of specialized knowledge clusters, and the explosive growth in October 2025 all point to a fundamental shift. I'm not just using Claude more—I'm using it differently. It has become:

- **A learning accelerator** for new technologies
- **A debugging partner** (+25% troubleshooting conversations)
- **A research assistant** (long-form deep dives on complex topics)
- **A thinking partner** (workflow optimization, problem structuring)

This isn't replacement—it's **augmentation**. The most valuable conversations are the ones where Claude helps me think better, not where it thinks for me.

**For the skeptics**: I get it. I was you two months ago. The difference is in how you use it. If you're frustrated with web interfaces and copy-paste workflows, try an integrated approach. The inflection point is real.
