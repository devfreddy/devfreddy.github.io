# Exploring Z.AI's GLM-4.6 with Roo: An Alternative to Claude Code

I've been experimenting with Z.AI's GLM-4.6 via Roo in VS Code as an alternative to Claude Code. It's not a perfect replacement, but the cost savings make it worth the trade-offs.

## The Appeal

- **Cost**: Substantially cheaper than Claude Code
- **Speed**: Competitive response times
- **Capability**: Handles most coding tasks reasonably well

The appeal isn't that it's *better*—it's that it's *good enough* while being significantly cheaper.

## The Trade-offs

Performance isn't always on par with Claude Code. Some tasks require more back-and-forth refinement, and complex multi-file edits occasionally have quirks.

## A Note on Cline

I initially tried **Cline** instead of Roo, but hit a dealbreaker: tool use would get stuck in a pending state. The extension would hang when executing operations, making it unusable. Roo doesn't have this problem.

## Takeaways

- For cost-conscious development, GLM-4.6 with Roo is a solid alternative
- Reliability matters—Roo's consistency beats Cline's tool-use issues
- The AI coding assistant landscape is maturing; having options means choosing based on trade-offs rather than default to a single tool
- For complex debugging or architectural decisions, Claude Code still wins. For iterative tasks, Roo works fine
