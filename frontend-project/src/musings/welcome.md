# Welcome to Musings

This is a space where I share thoughts, learnings, and observations from my work in technology and beyond.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Technical problems and solutions
- Patterns I've observed in software engineering
- Reflections on teamwork and collaboration
- Anything else that seems worth thinking through in public

## Why "Musings"?

Because these aren't polished articles or definitive guidesâ€”they're works in progress, just like the code we write. Sometimes the most valuable insights come from thinking out loud.

Thanks for stopping by.
